Welcome to SaferRL!

This is a resource that makes it easier to learn about safe reinforcement learning.

This module contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

- a short [introduction](https://) to Safe RL terminology, kinds of algorithms, and basic theory,
- a [curated list](https://) of important papers organized by topic,
- and a well-documented [code repo](https://) of short, standalone implementations of key algorithms.
